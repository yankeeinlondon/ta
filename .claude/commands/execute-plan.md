# Execute Plan with Phase Orchestrators

You are the **Plan Executor**. Your role is to orchestrate the execution of a multi-phase plan by spawning orchestrator agents for each phase, which in turn coordinate the specialized sub-agents (Rust Developer).

## Overview

```text
Plan Executor (Main Thread)
│
├── Phase 1 Orchestrator (Background Agent)
│   └── Rust Developer Sub-Agent
│
├── Phase 2 Orchestrator (Background Agent)
│   └── [Sub-agents based on phase ownership]
│
└── Phase N Orchestrator (Background Agent)
    └── [Sub-agents based on phase ownership]
```

## Prerequisites

Before starting:

1. Ensure required directories exist:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p .ai/plans .ai/logs
   ```

2. A plan must exist in `.ai/plans/` directory (format: `YYYY-MM-DD.plan-name.md`)
3. The plan should have phases with assigned principal owners
4. The plan should be in "Reviewed - Ready for Implementation" status

5. **Verify sub-agent definitions are accessible:**

   Required agent files (in `.claude/agents/`):
   - `agents/rust-developer.md`

### Plan Validation Checklist

Before executing, verify the plan contains:

- [ ] All phases have assigned principal owners
- [ ] Dependencies between phases are explicitly listed
- [ ] Each phase has acceptance criteria
- [ ] Parallelization groups are defined
- [ ] No circular dependencies exist
- [ ] Files to create/modify are specified for each phase
- [ ] **Blast radius is defined for each phase** (test scope for regression detection)

---

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Orchestrator Pattern Warning

**PROBLEM:** Orchestrators may write completion reports WITHOUT actually implementing code.

**This has happened before:** Orchestrators created detailed phase completion reports, wrote log files, and claimed "COMPLETE" status, but NO actual code files were created. The filesystem was unchanged, no dependencies were added, and no tests were written.

**Why This Happens:**
- Orchestrators confuse "writing about what should be done" with "actually doing it"
- They simulate completion by creating detailed reports instead of delegating to implementation agents
- They report success based on PLANNING, not on VERIFICATION of actual filesystem changes

**MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS for Orchestrators:**

1. **VERIFY FILES EXIST** - Before reporting completion, orchestrators MUST:
   ```bash
   # Check that expected files were created
   ls -la [expected-file-path]
   # Check that dependencies were added
   grep -q "[dependency-name]" Cargo.toml
   # Check that tests pass
   cargo test [test-pattern]
   ```

2. **DISTINGUISH PLANNING FROM IMPLEMENTING** - Orchestrators must understand:
   - ✅ CORRECT: Spawn sub-agent → wait for completion → verify files exist → report success
   - ❌ WRONG: Read requirements → write detailed report → claim success without verification

3. **FILESYSTEM IS THE SOURCE OF TRUTH** - Success means:
   - ✅ Files created in the locations specified by the plan
   - ✅ Dependencies added to Cargo.toml
   - ✅ Tests passing (not just "tests would pass")
   - ❌ NOT: "I wrote a detailed log saying files were created"

4. **REPORTS ≠ IMPLEMENTATION** - A completion report is NOT evidence of success. Only actual code in the codebase counts.

**Validation Checkpoints for Orchestrators:**

Before reporting "PHASE COMPLETE", orchestrators MUST:
- [ ] List files that were supposed to be created
- [ ] Run `ls` commands to verify each file exists
- [ ] Run `cargo test` within the blast radius to prove tests pass
- [ ] Report ACTUAL file paths, line counts, and test results
- [ ] If files don't exist, report BLOCKED, not COMPLETE

**If you are an orchestrator and cannot verify files exist, you MUST:**
1. Report status as BLOCKED, not COMPLETE
2. Explain what verification failed
3. Ask for clarification on how to proceed

This is NON-NEGOTIABLE. Reporting completion without filesystem verification is considered a critical failure.

---

## Step 0: Pre-Flight Checks

Before executing a plan, verify the environment is ready:

1. **Clean working directory:**
   ```bash
   git status --porcelain
   # Should be empty or only expected changes
   ```
   If there are uncommitted changes, ask the user whether to:
   - Stash them (`git stash`)
   - Commit them first
   - Proceed anyway (risky)

2. **Tests passing (if NOT starting with a design phase):**
   ```bash
   cargo test
   ```
   **NOTE:** If the first phase is a DESIGN phase, you may skip this check.

   If tests fail AND the first phase is an implementation phase, stop and report to user. Don't start plan execution with a failing test suite unless the plan begins with design work.

3. **Build succeeds:**
   ```bash
   cargo build
   ```

4. **Linting passes:**
   ```bash
   cargo clippy -- -D warnings
   cargo fmt --check
   ```

5. **Required tools available:**
   Verify any tools mentioned in the plan are available (e.g., specific CLI tools, database connections).

6. **Agent files accessible:**
   ```bash
   ls .claude/agents/*.md
   # Should list all required sub-agent definitions
   ```

If any pre-flight check fails, report to the user and ask whether to proceed or fix the issue first.

---

## Step 1: Identify and Load the Plan

**Actions:**

1. **List available plans:**
   ```bash
   ls -la .ai/plans/
   ```

2. **If argument provided:** Load the specified plan file
3. **If no argument:** Ask user which plan to execute

4. **Read and parse the plan:**
   - Extract all phases
   - Identify principal owners for each phase
   - **Extract blast radius for each phase** (test scope pattern)
   - Note parallelization groups
   - Identify dependencies between phases

5. **Create execution log:**
   - Path: `.ai/logs/YYYY-MM-DD.plan-execution-log.md`
   - Document plan name, phases, and execution strategy

---

## Step 2: Analyze Parallelization Strategy

Review the plan's parallelization section and create an execution order:

```markdown
## Execution Order Analysis

**Independent Phases (can run in parallel):**
- Phase 1: [Name] - Owner: [Rust Developer]
- Phase 2: [Name] - Owner: [Schema Architect]

**Dependent Phases (must wait):**
- Phase 3: [Name] - Depends on: Phase 1, Phase 2

**Execution Groups:**
1. Group A: Phases [1, 2] - Launch in parallel
2. Group B: Phase [3] - Launch after Group A completes
```

---

## Step 3: Launch Phase Orchestrators

For each execution group, spawn orchestrator agents. Use `run_in_background: true` for parallel execution.

### Orchestrator Agent Template

For each phase, spawn an orchestrator using this pattern:

```typescript
Task({
    subagent_type: "general-purpose",
    description: "Orchestrate Phase N: [Phase Name]",
    model: "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929",
    run_in_background: true,
    prompt: `You are the **Phase Orchestrator** for Phase [N]: [Phase Name].

## Your Role
You coordinate the execution of this phase by spawning and managing specialized sub-agents. You are responsible for:
1. Reading the phase requirements from the plan
2. Spawning appropriate sub-agents based on ownership
3. Coordinating parallel work when possible
4. Reporting status updates frequently
5. Consolidating results and reporting completion

## Context
- **Plan File:** .ai/plans/[plan-file-name].md
- **Phase Number:** [N]
- **Principal Owner:** [Rust Developer / Database Expert / Schema Architect]
- **Dependencies:** [None / List of dependent phases that must be complete]
- **Blast Radius:** [Test scope pattern from plan, or empty string for all tests]

## Status Updates
You MUST provide frequent status updates by outputting clear status messages:
- When starting a sub-task
- When a sub-agent completes
- When encountering issues
- When the phase completes

Use this format for status updates:
\`\`\`
[PHASE N STATUS] [TIMESTAMP]
Current Task: [what's happening]
Sub-Agents Active: [list]
Progress: [X/Y tasks complete]
Next Action: [what's next]
\`\`\`

## Workflow

### Step 1: Load Phase Details
1. Read the plan file at .ai/plans/[plan-file-name].md
2. Extract Phase [N] details including:
   - Goal and deliverables
   - Technical details
   - Acceptance criteria
   - Files to create/modify
3. **Detect phase type:**
   - **DESIGN phase:** Architecture, API design, schema design, planning, research
   - **IMPLEMENTATION phase:** Code, tests, features
4. **Route to appropriate workflow:**
   - If DESIGN phase → Follow Design Phase Workflow (see below)
   - If IMPLEMENTATION phase → Follow Implementation Workflow (standard)

### Step 2: Read Sub-Agent Guidelines
Load the guidelines for the principal owner and any supporting sub-agents:
- .claude/agents/rust-developer.md

---

## Design Phase Workflow (for Design Phases Only)

**If this is a DESIGN phase, follow this workflow instead of the implementation workflow.**

### Step 1: Create Design Phase Log

Create a log file for this design phase:
- Path: `.ai/logs/YYYY-MM-DD.[planName]-phase-[N]-log.md`

Document:
- Phase type: DESIGN
- Design goals
- Repo starting position
- Design work log section (to be updated)

### Step 2: Explore Existing Architecture

Before creating design artifacts:

1. **Read existing design docs:**
   - ADRs (Architecture Decision Records)
   - Schema definitions
   - API specifications

2. **Search for relevant code:**
   - Existing types/structs
   - Similar patterns in the codebase

3. **Document findings in log:**
   - Patterns discovered
   - Constraints identified
   - Related files reviewed

### Step 3: Create Design Artifacts

Based on the phase deliverables, create design artifacts:

**Common design artifacts:**
- Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) in `docs/adr/` or `.ai/adr/`
- API specifications
- Schema definitions
- Type definitions (Rust structs)
- Diagrams (using mermaid in markdown)
- Planning documents

**For schema/type design:**
- May spawn Schema Architect sub-agent
- Create type definitions with documentation
- Define data models

**For API design:**
- Define interfaces/traits
- Document parameters and return types
- Create usage examples

**Update log file as work progresses:**
```markdown
### Design Artifacts Created

**[Timestamp]** - Created ADR: [title]
- Path: `docs/adr/NNNN-title.md`
- Decision: [summary]

**[Timestamp]** - Defined schema: [name]
- Path: `path/to/schema.rs`
- Key types: [list]
```

### Step 4: Validate Design

**Design validation does NOT involve running tests.** Instead:

1. **Check consistency:**
   - Do all design artifacts align?
   - Are naming conventions consistent?
   - Are there contradictions?

2. **Review against acceptance criteria:**
   - Mark each criterion as satisfied or note gaps

3. **Verify completeness:**
   - All deliverables from plan created?
   - Open questions documented?

4. **Check if implementation is needed:**
   - If phase includes skeleton code/stubs, verify they compile
   - Run `cargo check` to verify syntax
   - Do NOT require tests to pass (this is design, not implementation)

### Step 5: Report Design Phase Completion

Return a summary with:

```markdown
## Phase [N] Complete: [Phase Name] (DESIGN PHASE)

**Status:** COMPLETE

**Completion Time:** [timestamp]

**Design Artifacts Created:**
- `path/to/adr.md` - [ADR title] - [summary]
- `path/to/schema.rs` - [Schema name] - [key types]
- `path/to/api-spec.md` - [API description]

**Key Design Decisions:**
1. [Decision 1 with rationale]
2. [Decision 2 with rationale]

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] Criterion 1
- [x] Criterion 2

**Open Questions (if any):**
- [Question and proposed answer]

**Notes for Implementation Phases:**
- [Context for developers]
- [Constraints to be aware of]

**No tests required for design phase.**
```

---

## Implementation Workflow (for Implementation Phases Only)

**If this is an IMPLEMENTATION phase, follow this workflow.**

### Step 3: Execute Phase Work

Based on the phase deliverables, spawn sub-agents to do the work.

**For each deliverable/task in the phase:**

1. **Identify the right sub-agent** based on task type:
   - Core Rust development → Rust Developer
   - Database/SurrealDB work → Database Expert
   - Schema/type design → Schema Architect

2. **Spawn sub-agent using this pattern:**

\`\`\`typescript
Task({
    subagent_type: "general-purpose",
    description: "[Task description]",
    model: "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929",
    run_in_background: [true if can parallelize, false if sequential],
    prompt: \`You are the [Sub-Agent Type] sub-agent working on Phase [N].

## Context
Read your expertise guidelines in: .claude/agents/[sub-agent-file].md

## Plan Context
Read the full plan at: .ai/plans/[plan-file-name].md
Focus on Phase [N]: [Phase Name]

## Your Task
[Specific task description from the phase deliverables]

## Technical Requirements
- Files to create/modify: [list from plan]
- Key functions/components: [list from plan]
- Integration points: [list from plan]

## Acceptance Criteria
[Copy acceptance criteria from plan]

## Output Requirements
1. Implement the required functionality
2. Create necessary tests
3. Ensure code follows project patterns
4. Return a summary of:
   - Files created/modified
   - Key implementation decisions
   - Any issues encountered
   - Suggested next steps\`
})
\`\`\`

3. **Collect sub-agent results:**
   - Use TaskOutput to get results from background sub-agents
   - Track completion status
   - Note any issues or blockers

4. **Handle parallel sub-agents:**
   - If multiple sub-agents can work in parallel, launch them together
   - Wait for all to complete before proceeding to dependent tasks

### Step 4: Validate Phase Completion

**⚠️ CRITICAL:** You MUST verify actual filesystem changes before reporting completion. Reports without verification are considered failures.

**NOTE:** For DESIGN phases, validation focuses on design artifacts (ADRs, schemas, docs). For IMPLEMENTATION phases, validation requires working code and passing tests.

#### For Design Phases:

1. **VERIFY DESIGN ARTIFACTS EXIST:**
   ```bash
   # List each design artifact
   ls -lah docs/adr/[adr-file].md
   ls -lah path/to/schema.rs
   # Show content to prove it's not empty
   wc -l docs/adr/[adr-file].md
   head -20 docs/adr/[adr-file].md
   ```

2. **VERIFY SKELETON CODE COMPILES (if applicable):**
   ```bash
   cargo check
   ```
   Design phases may include stub code, but do NOT require tests to pass.

3. **CHECK ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:**
   - Review each design criterion from the plan
   - Mark as VERIFIED with evidence (file paths, snippets)

4. **REPORT DESIGN PHASE COMPLETE** if all artifacts exist and compile (if code present)

#### For Implementation Phases:

1. **VERIFY FILES EXIST (MANDATORY):**

   For EVERY file listed in "Files to create/modify" in the plan:
   ```bash
   # List the file and show it exists
   ls -lah [file-path]
   # Show line count to prove it's not empty
   wc -l [file-path]
   # Show first few lines to prove it has content
   head -20 [file-path]
   ```

   **If ANY expected file doesn't exist:**
   - DO NOT report COMPLETE
   - Report BLOCKED with explanation
   - List which files are missing

   Example verification:
   ```bash
   ls -lah lib/src/analysis/types.rs          # Must show file exists
   wc -l lib/src/analysis/types.rs            # Must show >0 lines
   grep -q "pub struct TypeInfo" lib/src/analysis/types.rs  # Verify content
   ```

2. **VERIFY DEPENDENCIES ADDED (if applicable):**

   If the plan specifies adding dependencies to Cargo.toml:
   ```bash
   # Verify dependency exists in Cargo.toml
   grep "[dependency-name]" Cargo.toml
   ```

   Example:
   ```bash
   grep "oxc" lib/Cargo.toml  # Must show the dependency line
   ```

3. **RUN TESTS WITHIN BLAST RADIUS:**

   - If blast radius is empty string, run all tests: \`cargo test\`
   - If blast radius is a pattern, run scoped tests: \`cargo test [pattern]\`

   **IMPORTANT:** Actually RUN the tests, don't just write about running them

   ```bash
   cargo test analysis::  # Example for analysis module
   ```

   Document:
   - **Test count BEFORE:** How many tests existed before this phase
   - **Test count AFTER:** How many tests exist after this phase
   - **New tests added:** Difference between before and after
   - **Pass/fail status:** All tests must pass (or pre-existing failures documented)

4. **RUN QUALITY CHECKS:**
   ```bash
   cargo clippy -- -D warnings  # Linting
   cargo fmt --check            # Formatting
   cargo build                  # Compilation
   ```

   **If clippy or build fail:** Report BLOCKED, not COMPLETE

5. **CHECK ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:**
   - Review each criterion from the plan
   - Mark each as VERIFIED or NOT VERIFIED
   - Provide evidence (file paths, test names, grep results)
   - Document any gaps

6. **UPDATE PHASE STATUS:**
   - Only mark as COMPLETE if ALL verifications pass
   - If any verification fails, mark as BLOCKED or PARTIAL

### Step 5: Report Completion

Return a comprehensive summary:

\`\`\`markdown
## Phase [N] Complete: [Phase Name]

**Status:** COMPLETE / PARTIAL / BLOCKED

**Completion Time:** [timestamp]

**Deliverables Completed:**
- [x] [Deliverable 1]
- [x] [Deliverable 2]
- [ ] [Incomplete deliverable - if any]

**Files Created/Modified:**
- \`path/to/file1\` - [description] - [XXX lines]
- \`path/to/file2\` - [description] - [YYY lines]

**Filesystem Verification (MANDATORY - include actual command output):**
\`\`\`bash
$ ls -lah lib/src/analysis/types.rs
-rw-r--r--  1 user  staff   12K Dec 19 14:30 lib/src/analysis/types.rs

$ wc -l lib/src/analysis/types.rs
     273 lib/src/analysis/types.rs

$ grep "pub struct TypeInfo" lib/src/analysis/types.rs
pub struct TypeInfo {
\`\`\`

**Dependency Verification (if applicable):**
\`\`\`bash
$ grep "oxc" lib/Cargo.toml
oxc = { version = "0.5", features = ["parser", "ast"] }
\`\`\`

**Sub-Agents Used:**
- [Sub-Agent Type]: [Task] - [Status]
- [Sub-Agent Type]: [Task] - [Status]

**Blast Radius:** \`[test scope pattern]\`

**Test Results (within blast radius):**
- Tests run: X
- Passed: Y
- Failed: Z
- Starting failures: [list any pre-existing failures]
- Ending failures: [list any failures after implementation]
- New regressions: [None / list new failures]

**Quality Checks:**
- Clippy: [Pass/Fail with warnings count]
- Formatting: [Pass/Fail]
- Doc tests: [Pass/Fail]

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] Criterion 1
- [x] Criterion 2

**Issues Encountered:**
- [Issue 1 and resolution]
- [Issue 2 and resolution]

**Notes for Next Phase:**
- [Any important context for subsequent phases]
\`\`\`

Execute the phase now and report back with your summary.`
})
```

### Launching Parallel Phases

When phases can run in parallel, launch ALL orchestrators in a SINGLE message:

```typescript
// Launch Group A phases in parallel
Task({ /* Phase 1 Orchestrator */ run_in_background: true })
Task({ /* Phase 2 Orchestrator */ run_in_background: true })
```

---

## Step 4: Monitor and Coordinate

As the Plan Executor, your job is to:

### 4.1 Track Phase Progress

Use TodoWrite to track overall progress:

```markdown
- [ ] Phase 1: [Name] - [Owner] - Status: Running
- [ ] Phase 2: [Name] - [Owner] - Status: Running
- [ ] Phase 3: [Name] - [Owner] - Status: Waiting (depends on 1, 2)
```

### 4.2 Collect Results

Use TaskOutput to gather results from background orchestrators:

```typescript
TaskOutput({ task_id: "phase-1-orchestrator-id", block: true })
TaskOutput({ task_id: "phase-2-orchestrator-id", block: true })
```

### 4.3 Update Execution Log

After each phase completes, update `.ai/logs/YYYY-MM-DD.plan-execution-log.md`:

```markdown
## Execution Progress

### [Timestamp] - Phase 1 Complete
- Duration: X minutes
- Status: Success
- Key outcomes: [summary]

### [Timestamp] - Phase 2 Complete
- Duration: Y minutes
- Status: Success
- Key outcomes: [summary]
```

### 4.4 Launch Dependent Phases

Once a group completes, launch the next group of phases:

```typescript
// Group A complete, now launch Group B
Task({ /* Phase 3 Orchestrator */ run_in_background: true })
```

### 4.5 Handle Issues

If a phase reports issues:

1. Document in execution log
2. Decide whether to:
   - Retry the phase
   - Skip and continue (if non-blocking)
   - Stop execution and report to user
3. Update user on status

---

## Step 5: Completion and Reporting

When all phases complete:

### 5.1 Final Validation

1. **Run full test suite:**
   ```bash
   cargo test
   cargo test --doc   # doc tests
   ```

2. **Run full quality checks:**
   ```bash
   cargo clippy -- -D warnings
   cargo fmt --check
   cargo build --release
   ```

3. **Check for regressions:**
   - Compare against initial test state
   - Document any new failures

4. **Build TypeScript handler types (if modified):**
   ```bash
   cd ts && pnpm build
   ```

### 5.2 Update Plan Status

Edit the plan file to mark as implemented:

```markdown
**Status:** Implemented

## Implementation Summary

**Completed:** [Date]
**Total Duration:** [time]

**Phases Completed:**
- Phase 1: [Name] - Complete
- Phase 2: [Name] - Complete
- Phase 3: [Name] - Complete
```

### 5.3 Final Report to User

Provide a comprehensive summary:

```markdown
## Plan Execution Complete

**Plan:** [Plan Name]
**Execution Time:** [Total duration]
**Status:** SUCCESS / PARTIAL SUCCESS / FAILED

### Phase Summary

| Phase | Name | Owner | Status | Duration |
|-------|------|-------|--------|----------|
| 1 | [Name] | [Owner] | Complete | Xm |
| 2 | [Name] | [Owner] | Complete | Ym |
| 3 | [Name] | [Owner] | Complete | Zm |

### Files Changed

## Execution Checklist

Use this checklist to track your progress:

- [ ] Plan file identified and loaded
- [ ] **Phase types identified** (DESIGN vs IMPLEMENTATION for each phase)
- [ ] Execution log created
- [ ] Parallelization strategy analyzed
- [ ] Execution groups identified
- [ ] Group A phases launched
- [ ] Group A phases completed (validated appropriately for phase type)
- [ ] Group B phases launched (if applicable)
- [ ] Group B phases completed (if applicable)
- [ ] All phases completed
- [ ] **Full test suite run (if any implementation phases)**
- [ ] **Design artifacts verified (if any design phases)**
- [ ] Quality checks passed
- [ ] Plan status updated
- [ ] Final report provided to user

---

## Error Handling

### Phase Fails

If a phase orchestrator reports failure:

1. Log the failure details
2. Check if dependent phases can still proceed
3. Ask user whether to:
   - Retry the failed phase
   - Continue without it
   - Stop execution

### Sub-Agent Timeout

Default timeout values:
- Phase orchestrators: 10 minutes (600000ms)
- Sub-agent tasks: 5 minutes (300000ms)
- Total plan execution: No limit (monitored by user)

To configure timeouts, use the `timeout` parameter in Task calls:

```typescript
Task({
    subagent_type: "general-purpose",
    description: "Orchestrate Phase N",
    model: "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929",
    run_in_background: true,
    timeout: 600000, // 10 minute timeout
    prompt: `...`
})
```

If a phase exceeds its timeout:

1. Log the timeout event with timestamp
2. Mark the phase status as `TIMEOUT` (distinct from `FAILED`)
3. Check if dependent phases can proceed
4. Continue to next phase if no blocking dependencies
5. Report timeout to user with recommendations:
   - Break the phase into smaller sub-phases
   - Increase the timeout for complex tasks
   - Investigate why the task is taking longer than expected

### Dependency Conflicts

If phases report conflicting changes:

1. Stop affected phases
2. Review conflicts
3. Coordinate resolution
4. Restart with corrected approach

---

## Checkpoint System

To enable recovery from failures, maintain checkpoints in the plan file after each phase completes:

### Checkpoint Format

Add an `## Execution Checkpoints` section to the plan file:

```yaml
## Execution Checkpoints

- phase_1:
    status: complete
    completed_at: 2025-12-19T14:30:00Z
    artifacts: [lib/src/feature.rs, lib/tests/feature_tests.rs]
- phase_2:
    status: complete
    completed_at: 2025-12-19T15:00:00Z
    artifacts: [cli/src/commands/feature.rs, tests/integration_tests.rs]
- phase_3:
    status: failed
    failed_at: 2025-12-19T15:30:00Z
    error: "Type error in parser.rs:42"
    last_successful_step: "Created parser module"
```

### Resuming from Checkpoint

When resuming a failed plan execution:

1. **Check for existing checkpoints:**
   ```bash
   grep -A 20 "## Execution Checkpoints" .ai/plans/[plan-file].md
   ```

2. **Identify the failed phase** and its last successful step

3. **Resume execution** by:
   - Skipping completed phases (verify their artifacts exist)
   - Restarting the failed phase from its last successful step
   - Continuing with remaining phases

4. **Update checkpoints** as each phase completes

### Checkpoint Best Practices

- Update checkpoint immediately after each phase completes
- Include artifact paths for verification during resume
- Record error messages verbatim for debugging
- Never delete checkpoint data until plan is fully complete

---

## Context Window Management

Phase orchestrators must actively manage context to prevent overflow in large multi-phase plans:

### Guidelines for Orchestrators

1. **Request summaries from sub-agents, not full file contents:**
   - Sub-agents should return only: status, file paths, key decisions, blockers
   - Full implementation details go to `.ai/logs/YYYY-MM-DD.[planName]-phase-N-details.md`

2. **Use the standard output format:**
   Sub-agents return a structured response with:
   ```markdown
   ### Summary (for orchestrator - max 500 tokens)
   [Brief status and key points]

   ### Details (written to log file)
   [Full implementation notes - orchestrator reads from file if needed]
   ```

3. **Store detailed outputs in log files:**

4. **Incremental summarization:**
   - After each phase, summarize key outcomes in the execution log
   - Don't carry full phase details forward to subsequent phases
   - Reference log files when detailed context is needed

5. **Sub-agent context instructions:**
   Include in sub-agent prompts:
   ```
   Return a SUMMARY to the orchestrator (max 500 tokens).
   Write DETAILED notes to: .ai/logs/YYYY-MM-DD.[planName]-phase-N-details.md
   ```

### Context Budget Guidelines

| Component | Target Budget |
|-----------|---------------|
| Phase summary to orchestrator | 500 tokens |
| Orchestrator's running state | 2000 tokens |
| Plan file reference | 1000 tokens |
| Error/blocker details | 500 tokens |

## Tips for Success

1. **Detect phase type** - Design phases need different validation than implementation phases
2. **Design phases** - Validate design artifacts exist and compile (if code); tests NOT required
3. **Implementation phases** - Require working code with passing tests
4. **Status updates are critical** - Users need visibility into long-running operations
5. **Launch parallel phases together** - Use a single message with multiple Task calls
6. **Track everything** - Update todos and logs frequently
7. **Handle failures gracefully** - Don't let one failure cascade unnecessarily
8. **Validate incrementally** - Run appropriate validation after each phase (design or tests)
9. **Keep context concise** - Sub-agents should return summaries, not full file contents
10. **Use quality checks** - Run clippy and fmt regularly to catch issues early
11. **Rust-specific** - Always verify with `cargo check`, `cargo test`, `cargo clippy`, and `cargo fmt`
12. **TypeScript handlers** - If modifying TypeScript handler types in `/ts`, run `cd ts && pnpm build`
