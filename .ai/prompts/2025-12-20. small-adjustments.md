# Small Adjustments

After having completed the first full release we have a working solution but there are some fixes we need to make:

1. the `--format/-f` is how you're supposed to set the output format; at least for the `source` command it doesn't work (doesn't recognize it at all). However, rather than fix it I'd like to change it to `--json` and `--html` to switch away from a console based output.

    ```txt
       💻❯ ../ta symbols --format json
      error: unexpected argument '--format' found

        tip: to pass '--format' as a value, use '-- --format'

      Usage: ta symbols [OPTIONS] [PATTERN]

      For more information, try '--help'.

      ken in ta/ts on  main [!?] is 📦 v1.0.0 🤖 v22.20.0
      💻❯ ../ta symbols -- --format json
      error: unexpected argument 'json' found

      Usage: ta symbols [OPTIONS] [PATTERN]

      For more information, try '--help'.
    ```

2. Filtering down results

    - currently you need to use the `-n/--name` switch to filter a result set; this switch should not be necessary
        - instead of `ta symbols -n Watch` the command's filter should just take parameters and allow `ta symbols Watch` to filter down to symbols 

3. Negative filters

    - in addition to being filter down to symbols with `Watch` in the name with `ta symbols Watch` 
    - it would be nice to have the inverse filter from `ta symbols '!Watch'` which would show all symbols _except_ those with `Watch` in them.

4. Global switches

    - I suspect that none of the switches configured with global scope (aka, across all commands) work
    - Also switches like `--verbose,-v` are really only useful at the command level but while `ta -v` does nothing more than `ta` (aka, show the help menu); I'd expect some variation from `ta source -v` but in fact the verbose switch is NOT available!

5. Colorization

    - although the original design document had clear instructions about colorizing HTML and Console output (`/docs/ast-and-colorization.md`) there appear to be no colorization on the console output and currently the `f/--format` switch doesn't work so I can't test the HTML output format
    - from my research I think we should be using the `colored` crate for the console
    - the color scheme for the console and HTML should be consistent

6. Testing

    - considering the large number of issues in the current implementation I find it troubling that our tests are all passing!
